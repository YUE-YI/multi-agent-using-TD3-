GPTD3: Gaussian Process and TD3 for Multi-Agent Coordination
Efficient leader-follower coordination in multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics using GP and TD3.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project introduces GPTD3, a two-stage collaborative strategy that combines Gaussian Process (GP) for dynamic modeling and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for policy optimization. It aims to address the leader-follower coordination problem in mobile multi-agent systems (MAS) with unknown dynamics.
